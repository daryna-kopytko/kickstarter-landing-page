I developed a landing page that easily adapts to any size gadget.
It is easy to operate and has an attractive design.
When using the size for mobile devices, the menu board is hidden
in the side slideout, which simplifies work and maintains a neat appearance
of the page. In this case, the block with slides hides all slides except
one, which keeps the page clean from unnecessary material.

Technologies used: HTML - structury the webpage. CSS - page styling. JavaScript - side menu for the mobile version of the site, the operation of buttons for changing the language, changing the slide for the tablet and mobile versions of the site, clearing the form
